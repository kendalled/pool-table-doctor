        Pool Table Moving
      </h1>
      <h3>
        Do you need your Pool Table moved to a new location?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We can move your pool table to a new location with a few days' notice if it is a home-style pool table, meaning it has a 3-piece slate top. If you are unsure about the slate top, please give us a call and we can usually determine it for you with a small description of the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can also move bar-type billiard tables (one-piece slate), but it will require at least a 7-day's notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rush service is available for emergency purposes.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Moving out of state?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We can properly crate your slate top for the moving company of your choice. It is important to be assured that your slate top is properly crated for the long road ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use enclosed vans or box trucks for moving pool tables to protect them from the elements.
