        Pool Table Disassembly
      </h1>
      <p>
        Pool table dismantling is also known as a “teardown” or “disassembly.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The Pool Table Doctor can dismantle any brand or style of pool table. Although this service does not take as long as others, we give the same amount of care as if we were assembling it. It is important to make sure all of the hardware stays in tacked and every piece stays together. Unfortunately, many times we have run into installers not following the proper disassembly procedure, forcing us to order new parts and hardware to be able to complete a re-assemble and costing our customers unneeded expenses.

        Dismantling is not only for moving. It is mostly needed for customers having their floors replaced. We can get to a home and have the pool table dismantled in roughly an hour. Once dismantled, we will move it into another room or into the garage.

        Other tables will need to be dismantled due to moving long distances, primarily out of state. Our experts can help you with loading your table’s parts into the moving truck for the same price. Crating is not necessary for moving yourself, however moving companies require it. If this is the case, we can crate it as well for an additional charge.

        Pool Table Slate Crating
      </h2>
      <p>
        Slate crating is required by most major moving companies, especially if moving out of state! 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Pool Table Doctor offers custom pool table slate crating. We will dismantle any slate pool table (assuming it has 3 pieces) and package it in our custom designed crate for safe and secure transporting. Every crate is built onsite to ensure a custom fit for your specific size pool table.
