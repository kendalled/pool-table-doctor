        Pool Table Bumper Replacements
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Pool Table Doctor offers cushion (bumper) replacements and repairs.

        Over time, cushion rubber becomes hard and/or dry rotted. This is caused mostly by pool tables being set up in a garage, porch, or sunlight beaming through the windows over time without cover. Other times, cushion rubber can do the exact opposite and become squishy like a stress ball. This happens when the pool table has been in a controlled climate but played on for a long time, such as tables in a pool hall. No matter what the circumstance, we can fix it!
