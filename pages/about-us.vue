        <b>The Pool Table Doctor</b> was originally founded in <b>1994</b> by Grant Twilley as a pool table service, moving, and installation company which also included a vending route that supplied several bars and restaurants with gaming equipment throughout the state of Iowa.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grant’s extensive knowledge of the billiard industry came from when he ran a high-volume service dept. for “The Rec Room” in Des Moines, IA. For several years, he was responsible for training dozens of billiard technicians and overseeing thousands of pool tables and gaming installations, all while keeping up with the company’s day-to-day service department needs with remarkable success!
