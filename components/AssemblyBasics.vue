              <strong>Step 1:</strong> The base or "cabinet" as it is called is assembled and leveled.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 2:</strong> We take the measurements to your room assuring the best possible clearances for your pool table so you are not hitting any walls with your cues, however, smaller rooms may require shorter cues to clear. (We carry a full line of "Trouble Shooter" cues if needed).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 3:</strong> We install the pool table slate which consists of three pieces. We then level the slate with shims NO wedges and match each piece to B.C.A. specifications. After the slate is perfectly matched we seam it with Beeswax.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 4:</strong> The cloth is installed by stapling, NOT gluing unless absolutely necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 5:</strong> The rails are installed squared and straight aligned down the side pocket, then all pockets are secured.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 6:</strong> We re-check the level on sides for any settling.
            </li>
