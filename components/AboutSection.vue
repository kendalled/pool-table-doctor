        <!-- bullet points -->
        <p class="mt-8">Grant’s extensive knowledge of the billiard industry came from when he ran a high-volume service department for “The Rec Room” in Des Moines, Iowa.<br/><br/> For several years, he was responsible for training dozens of billiard technicians and overseeing thousands of pool tables and gaming installations, all while keeping up with the company’s day-to-day service department needs with remarkable success!</p>
