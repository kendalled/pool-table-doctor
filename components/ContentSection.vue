      <h3>
        What does it mean when companies say, “All tables vary in assembly"?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Some companies will hire sub-contracted technicians with little or no experience, and experience is key when recovering or setting up a pool table. The main reason for this is the amount of time involved in leveling and smoothing the play surface (the most important part). Some "experts” will make the mistake that if a pool table has been set-up for a while, it doesn’t need to be leveled again during the recovery process. This is not the case.
